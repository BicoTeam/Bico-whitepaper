# BICO Whitepaper

Everything you need for a successful ICO in the **world's first ICO funded book**



## Vision and mission

BICO is the world's first ICO funded book that will teach entrepreneurs how get funding for their projects and also teach beginner investors how to make informed decisions in the ICO world. We will teach you everything that is necessary to make your own successful ICO.

> *Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family* ---- Kofi Annan

Our vision is that ICOs will be accessible to everybody and perceived as a regular way of funding your own startup. Our mission is to bring clearness, knowledge and information to the world of cryptocurrencies.


## Team

We are a team of technical people and we like to make informed decisions and convey to clear tasks.

We decided to try an ICO ourselves and to write everything that we are going through in a book. Our ultimate goal is to learn how to do an ICO properly so we won't screw up our future goal, which is to help out planting trees. We are contacting the best and most successful ICOs to learn from them and apply their advices directly in BICO, and of course, all their tips and stories will be included in the book as case studies. You might also be wondering whether or not we are such good writers as to publish a guidebook, but do not worry, because our advisors have already written best-sellers and will make sure that we launch the best possible book.

## Business Opportunity

Over half a billion dollars has been raised through so-called "Initial Coin Offerings" (ICOs) since the start of the year 2017. Is this a bubble? No, it's not, we believe **ICOs are the future of startup funding**.

Unlike with the traditional Venture Capitalist system where you lose six months to a year raising money, here you don’t lose any time, entrepreneurs can focus in what they are really good at, building their projects, their products and their startups. Moreover, when you get money from a Venture Capitalist you get money from one person or perhaps one team.  Whereas with token crowdfunding, you can get thousands of engaged supporters who are extremely motivated to see your company succeed. They are your early adopters, they are your evangelists.

It is to expect then that in a near future every startup will try to carry out an ICO, but **there is a lack of clearness and information**, first because it is relatively new, and second because of the complex rules in the world of cryptocurrencies.  By following a *token utility model*, where the token is used to purchase our ICO guidebook in the platform we will ensure that BICO has an inherent value and there will be sustained demand for the token once the book is launched.

### BIG impact:
We are the world's first ICO funded book, and that comes with big meaning and responsibility. We love what BICO stands for and what BICO represents.

### A guide that everybody will need:
As the future of startup fundings relies on ICOs, every single entrepreneur will need this guide to make their projects come true. What better proof that our guide will work than the fact that we have been investigating and doing our own ICO to show the rest of the world how to do it right the first time. You won't fall into the same pitholes we have fallen into, and you will learn everything along the way. Imagine a very clear step by step guide on how to get funding for your next project using cryptocurrencies, that is the real opportunity here. And of course, the better the ICO goes the better content we can deliver in the guidebook.




## Why in Ethereum?

BICO will be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token. The Ethereum blockchain is currently the industry standard for issuing custom digital assets and smartcontracts. The ERC20 token interface allows for the deployment of a standard token that is compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as development tools, wallets, and exchanges. Ethereum’s ability to deploy Turing-complete trustless smart contracts enables complex issuance rules for cryptocurrencies, digital financial contracts, and automated incentive structures. These advanced features and active ecosystem make Ethereum the perfect place for investor and projects looking for funding. However, the information is very limited and the knowledge is not evenly distributed wordlwide.

## Timeline and Roadmap
In the following lines you can see a glimpse of the action plan. The Timeline represents all the steps needed to finalise the ICO successfully and the steps needed to create the Guidebook. It also emphasises key moments on time, it doesn't represent the permanent continuous work.

- **1st August:**  We came together to build a new project that would help with reforestation of the planet.


- **5th August:**  We looked for funding sources. We realised that there was a lack of information about ICOs. We didn't want to screw up our startup in the funding process. The idea of BICO appears.


- **15th August:** Full weekend Hackathon to make the first skeleton of the website and Whitepaper. First tests with Smart Contracts in Ethereum. Final logo design.


- **20th August:** Set up of mailing and subscription system.


- **3rd September** Set up communities and social media.


- **18th September:** Active communication starts. We go public.


- **20th October:** Official Crowdsale starts.


- **20th December:** Crowdsale finishes successfully. It is possible to trade BICOs in exchange lists.


- **21st December:** Guidebook creation starts.


- **20th June:** Within a maximum period of 6 months the book will be finished. Start delivering the guidebook to eligible investors.


- **30th June:** All investors, who have bought 1500 BICOs or more, have received the book.


- **1st July:** Book is open and accessible to the public at a higher price than the one from the crowdsale.



## Economic and Financial Plan. Use of Funds


Regarding the smart contract and the token distribution, 5 million BICO tokens will be created. From those 5 million, half will be retained and kept within the team as a reserve. The other 2.5 millions will be available for sale in regulation during the ICO. A few days before the official crowdsale starts, a Pre-Sale event will take place with BONUS tokens, where 10% of the available BICOs will be at half the price.

The goal of this ICO is to raise 47200$. We want to be as transparent as we can, that's why we are disclosing the way we are going to be using the funds. Let us build from trust. Let us build for true transparency. This is obviously a piece of text in a website and you will have to trust us, but please do, we are genuinely trying to help :)
