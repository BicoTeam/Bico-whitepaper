# BICO Whitepaper

Everything you need for a successful ICO in the **world's first ICO funded book**



## Business Plan
BICO is the world's first ICO funded book that will teach enterprenheurs get funding for their projects and beginner investors to make informed decisions. We will teach everything that is necessary to make your own successful ICO.
Our vision is that ICOs will be accesible to everybody and perceived as normal as taking one more step in the process of making your own startup
Our mission is to bring clearness, knowledge and information to the world of cryptocurrencies.
We were trying to do another ICO for our project (that aims to help mother nature) and we realised that there is not much information about how to do it right. There are not tutorials available, only a few blogposts that never go into details. The knowledge is not evenly distributed.
   
We are a team of technical people and we like to make informed decissions and convey to clear tasks.

We decided to try an ICO ourselves and to write everything that we are going to experience on a book.  Our ultimate goal is to learn how to do an ICO properly and so we won't screw our true goal, which is to help out planting trees. We will be learning on the way and we hope you also want to learn with us. These are the steps we will follow.

- Investigate, learn, read, open and honest communication
- Offer something in return for the invested money… maybe a comprehensive book? A book to teach you how we did it. Not only tell you how, we will guide you step by step, with code repositories, examples and everything you will need
- Send you the book as the return on your investment so you can safely and without obstacles do the ICO you need for your own project
- The book will be also available after the crowdsale, so the project will keep growing afterwards. Maybe translating this into a more valuable token.

## Business Opportunities



## Market Study

## BICO Token Sale info

BICO will be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token. The Ethereum blockchain is currently the industry standard for issuing custom digital assets and smartcontracts. The ERC20 token interface allows for the deployment of a standard token that is compatiblewith the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as development tools, wallets, and exchanges. Ethereum’s ability to deploy Turing-complete trustless smart contracts enables complex issuance rules for cryptocurrencies, digital financial contracts, and automated incentive structures. These advanced features and active ecosystem make Ethereum the perfect place for investor and projects looking for funding. However, the information is very limited and the knowledege is not evenly distributed wordlwide.
