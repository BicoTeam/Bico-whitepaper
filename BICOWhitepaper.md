# BICO Whitepaper

Everything you need for a successful ICO in the **world's first ICO funded book**



## Vision and mission

BICO is the world's first ICO funded book that will teach entrepreneurs how get funding for their projects and also teach beginner investors to make informed decisions. We will teach you everything that is necessary to make your own successful ICO.
Our vision is that ICOs will be accesible to everybody and perceived as a regular way of funding your own startup

Our mission is to bring clearness, knowledge and information to the world of cryptocurrencies.
  
## Team

We are a team of technical people and we like to make informed decissions and convey to clear tasks.

We decided to try an ICO ourselves and to write everything that we are going through in a book. Our ultimate goal is to learn how to do an ICO properly so we won't screw up our true goal, which is to help out planting trees. We will be learning on the way and we hope you want to join us in the process. 

## Business Opportunity

We think the business opportunity comes from the fact that we have been investigating and doing our own ICO to show the rest of the world how to do it right the first time. You won´t fall into the same pitholes we have fallen into, and you will learn everything along the way. Imagine a very clear step by step guide on how to get funding for your next project using cryptocurrencies, that is the opportunity here.

## Why in Ethereum?

BICO will be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token. The Ethereum blockchain is currently the industry standard for issuing custom digital assets and smartcontracts. The ERC20 token interface allows for the deployment of a standard token that is compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as development tools, wallets, and exchanges. Ethereum’s ability to deploy Turing-complete trustless smart contracts enables complex issuance rules for cryptocurrencies, digital financial contracts, and automated incentive structures. These advanced features and active ecosystem make Ethereum the perfect place for investor and projects looking for funding. However, the information is very limited and the knowledege is not evenly distributed wordlwide.


## Economic and Financial Plan. Use of Funds

We want to be as transparent as we can, that's why we are disclosing the way we are going to be using the funds. This is obviously a piece of text in a website and you will have to trust us, but please do, we are genuinly trying to help :)
